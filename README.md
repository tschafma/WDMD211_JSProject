# WDMD211_JSProject: Albumify -
A jQuery plugin of sorts. Apply the .albumify() method on a div, and watch the entire webpage transform...

Using a JSON file with a list of just Albums and Artists, generate a preview library of your favorite music.

All the information and media generated is taken just from Spotify's API (so far).

Features Include:
  - 30 second previews of each song on a given album
  - Close up view of Album Art
  - List of related albums and their Spotify Links
  - Artist Picture
  - Artist's top 10 tracks

Possible Planned Features:
  - Search function which will dynamically add Albums given a user's search
  - Possible Spotify Log-on feature, to get access to full songs and users' playlists
  - Display related artists
  - Artist Bio
  - Custom Colors/Styles
